## 🔄 **Complete System Flow**

### **Phase 1: Order Creation**
```
Client Portal → CMS → Middleware → WMS
```

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Customer Action**: Client logs into Client Portal and creates a new order
2. **Data Input**: Client provides:
   - Weight of package
   - Delivery location
   - Package details
3. **CMS Processing**: Order stored in CMS database with status "On_The_Way"
4. **Automatic Sync**: Middleware automatically creates corresponding order in WMS
5. **WMS Storage**: Order stored in WMS with status "pending"

**Data Flow:**
```json
Client Portal Request → {
  "client_id": 1,
  "weight": 5,
  "location": "Downtown Office"
}

CMS Response → {
  "id": 123,
  "client_id": 1,
  "status": "On_The_Way",
  "weight": 5,
  "location": "Downtown Office"
}

WMS Auto-Creation → {
  "order_id": "123",
  "client_name": "Client-1",
  "pickup_location": "Pickup Location",
  "delivery_location": "Downtown Office",
  "package_info": "Standard Package",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

### **Phase 2: Warehouse Processing**
```
Warehouse Management → WMS → Driver Assignment
```

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Order Discovery**: Warehouse staff views pending orders in Warehouse Management interface
2. **Order Borrowing**: Staff clicks "Borrow" to change status from "pending" → "borrowed"
3. **Driver Selection**: Available drivers are displayed in dropdown menu
4. **Assignment**: Staff selects driver and assigns order
5. **Status Update**: Order status changes to "assigned"
6. **Driver Availability**: Assigned driver status changes to "unavailable"

**Status Transitions:**
```
pending → [Borrow Action] → borrowed → [Assign Driver] → assigned
```

**Driver Assignment Process:**
```json
Available Drivers Query → [
  {
    "driver_id": "DRV1A0B52FA",
    "name": "Maria Rodriguez",
    "available": true
  }
]

Assignment Request → {
  "driver_id": "DRV1A0B52FA"
}

Assignment Response → {
  "message": "Driver assigned successfully",
  "order_id": "123",
  "driver_id": "DRV1A0B52FA"
}
```

### **Phase 3: Driver Operations**
```
Driver App → WMS → Delivery Management
```

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Driver Login**: Driver authenticates using driver_id
2. **Order Loading**: System fetches all orders assigned to this driver
3. **Order Filtering**: Only shows orders with status "assigned" and matching driver_id
4. **Delivery Management**: Driver can view order details and delivery location
5. **Status Updates**: Driver can mark orders as "delivered"
6. **Completion**: Order status changes to "delivered", driver becomes available again

**Driver Interface Flow:**
```json
Login Request → {
  "driver_id": "DRV1A0B52FA"
}

Orders Filter → orders.filter(order => 
  order.driver_id === "DRV1A0B52FA" && 
  order.status === "assigned"
)

Delivery Completion → {
  "message": "Order marked as delivered",
  "order_id": "123",
  "driver_id": "DRV1A0B52FA"
}
```

### **Phase 4: Real-time Monitoring**
```
System Activities → Event Tracking → Real-time Updates
```

**Continuous Processes:**
1. **Event Logging**: All system actions are logged with timestamps
2. **Auto-refresh**: Driver interface refreshes every 30 seconds
3. **Manual Refresh**: Users can manually refresh for immediate updates
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and user notifications
5. **Activity Monitoring**: System tracker shows real-time system activities
