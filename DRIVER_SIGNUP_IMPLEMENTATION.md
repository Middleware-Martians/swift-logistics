# Driver Signup Feature - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete driver signup feature for the Swift Logistics system, following the same pattern as client registration but tailored for drivers.

## ‚úÖ **What Was Implemented**

### 1. **Backend (WMS) - Enhanced Driver System**
- **Enhanced Database Schema**: Extended `drivers` table with:
  - `email` (unique) - Driver's email address
  - `phone` - Contact phone number  
  - `license_number` - Driver's license number
  - `created_at` - Registration timestamp

- **New API Endpoint**: `POST /drivers/signup`
  - Auto-generates unique Driver IDs (format: `DRV` + 8 hex chars)
  - Validates email uniqueness
  - Returns complete driver profile

- **Updated Existing Endpoints**: All driver endpoints now return enhanced driver data

### 2. **Middleware - API Proxy**
- **New Proxy Endpoint**: `POST /api/wms/drivers/signup`
- Follows same logging pattern as other middleware endpoints
- Provides clear error handling and request/response logging

### 3. **Frontend - Enhanced Driver App**
- **Updated Driver Registration Form** with fields:
  - Full Name (required)
  - Email Address (required) 
  - Phone Number (required)
  - Driver's License Number (required)

- **Improved User Experience**:
  - Auto-generated Driver IDs (no manual entry required)
  - Success message showing generated Driver ID
  - Enhanced driver profile display
  - Clear login instructions

- **Real-time System Integration**:
  - All API calls logged in System Activities panel
  - Request/Response data visible in dashboard
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
